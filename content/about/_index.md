ROR is the Research Organization Registry, a community-led project to develop an open, sustainable, usable, and unique identifier for every research organization in the world.

The scholarly community depends on a network of open identifier and metadata infrastructure. Content identifiers and contributor identifiers are foundational components of this network. But an additional component has been missing---until now, there has been no open, stakeholder-governed infrastructure for research organization identifiers and their associated metadata. With the aim of filling this gap, ROR launched in January 2019.

ROR is intended for use by the research community, for the purposes of increasing the use of organization identifiers in the community and enabling connections between organization records in various systems. Implementation of ROR IDs in scholarly infrastructure and metadata will enable more efficient discovery and tracking of research outputs across institutions and funding bodies.

##Governance

The Research Organization Registry is a cross-organizational and multi-stakeholder collaboration. It is led by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite, in conjunction with the ROR Steering Group, ROR project team, and ROR's advisory and working groups.

CDL, Crossref, and DataCite are the governing organizations that share the overall responsibility for coordinating the activities of the Research Organization Registry. All three governing organizations provide input on decisions and overall strategy that support the growth and sustainability of ROR by engaging in outreach to funders, potential adopters, and stakeholders in their respective networks.

A shared memorandum of agreement signed by the governing organizations outlines the scope and nature of their involvement and responsibilities. The agreement also includes provisions for one or more governing organizations to exit the agreement and how ROR would be responsibly dissolved if there are no organizations available to take over its coordination.

## ROR Structure
The following groups organize, implement, and participate in ROR activities. The project lead and main point of contact is [Maria Gould](mailto:info@ror.org), product manager at California Digital Library.

### Operations Team
Comprising the directors from each governing organization plus the ROR Project Lead, this group is responsible for resourcing, decision-making, and general operations. 

### Steering Group
Comprising the Operations Team plus an additional 4 members external to the governing organizations, this group provides input on decisions and overall strategy, and support for ROR's growth and sustainability through outreach to funders, potential adopters, and other stakeholders in their respective networks.

The current steering group representatives are:

-   **Matt Buys**, [DataCite](https://ror.org/04wxnsj81)
-   **John Chodacki**, [California Digital Library](https://ror.org/03yrm5c26)
-   **Daniel Hook**, [Digital Science](https://ror.org/02ktfc112)
-   **Clifford Lynch**, [Coalition for Networked Information](https://ror.org/043fjtb89)
-   **Ritsuko Nakajima**, [Japan Science and Technology Agency](https://ror.org/00097mb19)
-   **Ed Pentz**, [Crossref](https://ror.org/02twcfp32)
-   **Judy Ruttenberg**, [Association of Research Libraries](https://ror.org/053mpbz30)
-   **Ina Smith**, [Academy of Science of South Africa](https://ror.org/02qsf1r97)

### Project Team
Comprising representatives from each governing organization, this group is led by the ROR Project Lead and includes sub-groups focused on product development, outreach, and adoption. 

### Community Advisory Group
Comprising individuals from around the world representing a range of organization types, this is a voluntary group of users and stakeholders interested in adopting and championing ROR in their work and networks and who participate in regular meetings to discuss project updates and provide feedback. 

### Curation Team
Comprising ROR community members and the ROR Project Lead, this group advises on curation practices and standards for ROR to implement.

## Business Model 
ROR is designed to be a free service with optional fee-based services to be provided in the future. ROR data is freely and openly available without any restrictions under the terms of the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain dedication. ROR code is available on Github under a MIT License.

During its startup years (2019--2022) ROR relies on a mixed funding model and phased resourcing approach. Funding during this period comes from:

-   **In-kind support** from the ROR governing organizations

-   **Donations and contributions** from community stakeholder organizations

-   **Grants** (Institute for Museum and Library Services and the National Science Foundation).

Beginning in 2022, ROR will launch an optional paid service with enhanced features for certain users and user groups. The optional paid service will be designed and developed with community input.

## Sustainability & Guiding Principles

ROR's sustainability strategy has been developed according to and motivated by the following goals and principles.

-   **Focus on providing free and open data**: ROR data is CC0. It can never be owned by anyone, and future paid services won't impact access to the core data.

-   **Keep the scope manageable**: ROR is focused exclusively on providing core high-quality open data and infrastructure that is specific to the affiliation use case, can be easily implemented and integrated, and can be leveraged and built upon by external services and projects.

-   **Cultivate early and sustained community engagement and governance**: Community is key to ROR's success and longevity. Since Day 1, ROR has been focused on establishing a core base of community users invested in ROR's long-term success, driving adoption across the research landscape, and ensuring that ROR is attentive and adaptable to community needs.

-   **Maintain low overhead**: ROR does not need to be its own organization, but can succeed as a joint collaboration by steering organizations and wider community. In this way, costs and other overhead can be contained. 

-   **Diversify resourcing streams**: ROR is not reliant on a single source of funding but rather strategically resourced through a combination of in-kind funds from steering organizations, grant funding, community contributions, and (in future) optional add-on service fees.

## Financial Administration
Day-to-day bookkeeping and accounts payable/receivable functions are administered by the Crossref accounting team on behalf of ROR. Crossref is responsible for holding all shared ROR funds in a designated bank account. Transactions are processed and tracked in a way that allows ROR to have full access and authority over its funds. The ROR Project lead is the primary point of contact for ROR funds management. Payment decisions require a unanimous vote from the ROR Operations Team. The Operations Team will share financial reports with the ROR Steering Group and will prepare an annual report to be available to the broader community.

## History
ROR is the culmination of several years of extensive community collaboration to develop a shared vision for a registry of organization identifiers.

Between 2016 and 2018, a group of 17 organizations with a shared purpose invested their time and energy into an Org ID initiative with the goal of defining requirements for an open, community-led organization identifier registry that would benefit all of our communities. A number of activities took place as part of this initiative. Here is a brief timeline:

-   A series of collaborative workshops took place at the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) meeting in San Antonio TX (2016), the FORCE11 conference in Portland OR (2016), and at PIDapalooza in Reykjavik (2016).
-   Findings from these workshops were summarized in three documents, which were made openly available to the community for public comment: *Organization Identifier Project: A Way Forward* ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/2906)), *Organization Identifier Provider Landscape* ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/4716)), *Technical Considerations for an Organization Identifier Registry* ([PDF](https://doi.org/10.5438/7885))
-   A [Working Group](https://orcid.org/content/organization-identifier-working-group) worked throughout 2017 and voted to approve a core set of [governance recommendations](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Governance_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402002/1) and [product principles](https://figshare.com/articles/ORG_ID_WG_Product_Principles_and_Recommendations/5402047/1), drawing from conversations with community stakeholders:
-   A [Request for Information](https://doi.org/10.23640/07243.5458162.v1) sought expressions of interest from organizations to be involved in implementing and running an organization identifier registry.
-   Following an enthusiastic response to the RFI, there was a [stakeholder meeting in Girona](https://orcid.org/content/2018-org-id-meeting) in January 2018 at which ORCID, DataCite, and Crossref were tasked with drafting a proposal that met the Working Group's requirements.

In the discussions and planning process that followed the Girona meeting, it became clear that building a pilot registry would be a practical place to start, with governance and other community layers ultimately built around it. A new steering group consisting of California Digital Library, Crossref, DataCite, and Digital Science stepped up to implement the pilot, with a donation of seed data from Digital Science's GRID database. The pilot was called the Research Organization Registry and thus ROR was born!

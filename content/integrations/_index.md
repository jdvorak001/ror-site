See ROR IDs in the wild! A number of systems have integrated or are working on integrating with ROR to collect and display clean and consistent affiliation data. A partial list of current and pending early adopters follows below, with links to more information about their implementations (if available). Contact <info@ror.org> to add other examples to the list.

ROR has open data and infrastructure to facilitate integrations. Check out the ROR Github and public data dump and get in touch if you have questions or need assistance.
